Dagobert is intented to be an extensible library providing access to multiple bank accounts and financial services mainly through using HBCI. Dagobert was inspired by [HBCI4Java](https://github.com/hbci4j/hbci4java/). The library is intented to be used in server environments and web-applications.

## The name 'Dagobert'
Is taken from the German name of the comic figure *Scrooge McDuck* created by [Carl barks](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Barks). Like Dagobert/Scrooge McDuck the Dagobert library will count your money and help you master your expenses and income.
